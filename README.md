# Data Structure Topics Using CPP

Welcome to the **Data Structure Topics Using CPP** repository! üéâ  
This collection is designed for developers and students who want to understand and implement essential data structures in CPP. We focus on the following key topics:

- Searching Algorithms
- Sorting Techniques
- Stack Operations
- Queue Operations

Each topic is explained with code examples, making it easy to follow and apply in your projects.

## üìö Stack

### What is a Stack?

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

### Real-World Applications of Stack

- **Recursion:** Used in function call management.
- **Expression Evaluation and Parsing:** Parsing expressions like arithmetic or logical expressions.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** A graph traversal algorithm.
- **Undo/Redo Operations:** Common in text editors.
- **Browser History:** Navigate through the previous and next pages.
- **Function Calls:** Managing function calls in programming languages.

## üìö Queue

### What is a Queue?

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First in, First out‚Äù (FIFO) ** principle. This means the first element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.


### Real-World Applications of Queue
- **Task scheduling:** Managing tasks in a processor.
- **Data transfer:** Managing data packets in network communication
- **Simulation of real-world systems:** Example: Waiting lines in a supermarket
- **Priority Queues for Event Processing:**  Handling events in order of priority.

## üìö Array

### What is an Array?
An **Array** is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements, This structure provides efficient access and manipulation of data due to its fixed size and direct access to elements via indices.

### Real-World Applications of Arrays
- **Data Storage:** Arrays are used to store data in various applications, such as storing a list of student grades or names.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Arrays are fundamental in implementing sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, and bubblesort.
- **Database Management:** Arrays help manage records and handle fixed-size data fields efficiently.

## üìö Linked List
### What is a Linked List?
A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion or deletion of elements at any position.

### Real-World Applications of Linked Lists
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Useful for managing memory dynamically as nodes can be easily added or removed without reorganizing the   entire data structure.
- **Implementing Stacks and Queues:** Linked lists are often used to build stacks and queues because of their efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- **Navigation Systems:** Used in navigation, such as undo/redo operations in software, where nodes represent states or actions.
- **File Systems:** Linked lists are used in file systems to keep track of file blocks or data locations that are not stored contiguously.
